Problem 11581
=============

So, I was interested to see how this function played out. So, I made a "parent graph" really quickly using graphviz.  That's what graph.png is.  You can see that any node with a self loop has infinite recurrence.  I cannot see (at a glance) any longer cycles in this graph.
