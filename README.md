online-judge
============

I'm setting out on a mission to solve a thousand [UVa Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) problems by the time I graduate with my bachelor's degree.  This means I need to average a little more than a problem a day; this is going to be the repository for my solutions.  My best solutions will be stored in the `potw` (*P*roblem *O*f *T*he *W*eek) directory with more detailed comments.  These will be uploaded to [my blog](http://apnorton.blogspot.com) every Monday, along with an explanation of the program.
